# AI Engineer Task â€“ Document Review & ADGM Reference Ingestion

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation for an AI-assisted document review system designed to identify compliance issues in corporate and legal documents against the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) regulatory framework.  
The solution integrates rule-based checks with a reference dataset built from official ADGM document sources. The reference dataset can be queried to provide relevant legal evidence for each flagged issue.
